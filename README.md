# 34_NPL
Network Programming Lab

## Lab Cycle
1. Write simple java program for the following:  
  a. To find the factorial of a given number  
  b. To print the first n fibonacci series  
  c. To check whether a given string is palindrome
2. Familiarization of Basic Networking Commands and Network configuration files in
Linux
3. Familiarization of system calls used for operating system and network
programming in linux
4. Write a program to implement process creation
5. Write a program to implement a simple thread
6. Implementation of Inter Process Communication using  
  a. PIPE  
  b. Message Queue  
  c. Shared Memory
7. Implement Distance vector routing protocol
8. Implement Link state routing protocol
9. Implement Client Server Communication using socket programming and TCP as
transport layer protocol
10. Implement Client Server Communication using socket programming and UDP as
transport layer protocol
11. Implement a multi user chat server using TCP as Transport layer protocol
12. Implement Concurrent Time Server application using UDP to execute the program
at remote server. Client sends a time request to the server, server sends its system
time back to the client. Client displays the result
13. Implement Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
14. Develop concurrent file server which will provide the file requested by client if it
exists. If not server sends appropriate message to the client. Server should also send
its process ID (PID) to clients for display along with file or the message
15. Familiarization of Wireshark (home assignment)
16. Familiarization programs for GUI and Applet
